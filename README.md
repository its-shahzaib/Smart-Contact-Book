# Project Title & Description
## Project Title:
Smart Contact Book

## Description:
The Smart Contact Book is a web-based application developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course.
The purpose of this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly system for storing, searching, editing, deleting, and sorting contact information such as name, phone number, and email address.
This project demonstrates the practical application of core DSA concepts in a real-world scenario. Contacts are stored dynamically using a Linked List, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and updates. For displaying contacts in an organized manner, an Array is used along with the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort contacts alphabetically by name (A–Z).
The system offers an interactive web interface where users can:
Add new contacts
Search contacts by name or phone number
Edit existing contact details
Delete contacts
View and sort all contacts alphabetically
The Smart Contact Book highlights how fundamental data structures and algorithms can be integrated into modern web applications to improve data management, efficiency, and usability.
